Project #2 (due: 10/14)

Study the position data in Figure 3.5. Perform linear, quadratic, and cubic least-
squares fits and analyze the residual error. In each case, plot the polynomial and the data
together in one graph and the residual error in another. Verify the discussion in the text
and extract a value for the acceleration due to gravity. Solve any linear systems using LU
decomposition, as given in the procedure LUsolve, but separate this into two procedures,
one to decompose A into L and U and the other to solve LUx = b.
