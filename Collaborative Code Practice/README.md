I think that it'd be good for us to get some practice working on code collaboratively.  I've made a simple little C++
program that modifies a number in a way defined by three functions, one for each of us.  These functions are included
via three header files, also included in the program.

Your codes at present don't do anything to the number; they just spit out whatever they're given.  Mine returns the sine
squared in a roundabout way, just because I can.  You should make your .cpp file do something to the number, then run the
shell script I've included just to make sure it all still works.

If you want to try something a bit more complicated, we can do that.  I just figured we should start with something easy.  If
you have any problems, look at the documentation in my files or email me about it.
